# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This is a project for the Coursera online course: Getting and Cleaning Data.

### There are 3 files in this project:
* README.md: this file;
* CodeBook.md: contains information about the data analysed by run_analysis.R;
* run_analysis.R: The R script that creates a new tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the raw data.

More information about the raw data can be accessed here:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

### To run the script you must follow these steps:
1. Download the raw data from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip);
2. Extract the zip file into your R working directory;
3. Run the R script run_analysis.R. It will result in a text file named "result.txt".

#### Have fun!
